# DSM2

# General Description

[DSM2](http://baydeltaoffice.water.ca.gov/modeling/deltamodeling/models/dsm2v6/dsm2.cfm) is a river, estuary, and land modeling system.

- **River**: Can simulate riverine systems and has been extended from Sacramento to Shasta Dam. It has also been tested with high flow/stage simulations for flood modeling.
- **Estuary**: A completely flexible estuary model; stages and flows may be specified at boundary and internal points.
- **Land**: Includes effects from land-based processes, such as consumptive use and agricultural runoff.

DSM2 can calculate stages, flows, velocities, and many mass transport processes, including salts, multiple non-conservative constituents, temperature, THM formation potential, and individual particles.
