# General Description

<a
href="http://baydeltaoffice.water.ca.gov/modeling/deltamodeling/models/dsm2v6/dsm2.cfm"
rel="nofollow">DSM2</a> is a river, estuary, and land modeling system.

-   *River* - Can simulate riverine systems, and has been extended from
    Sacramento to Shasta Dam. Also has been tested with high flow/stage
    simulations for flood modeling.
-   *Estuary* - Completely flexible estuary model; stages and flows may
    be specified at boundary and internal points.
-   *Land* - Includes effects from land-based processes, such as
    consumptive use and agricultural runoff.

DSM2 can calculate stages, flows, velocities; many mass transport
processes, including salts, multiple non-conservative constituents,
temperature, THM formation potential and individual particles.
