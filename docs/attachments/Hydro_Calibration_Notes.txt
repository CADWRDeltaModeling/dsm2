This the Hydro Calibration note for the V8.1beta release

Use 15min time step for Hydro runs.

Start with WY2002

Run1: Start with 2009 BDCP Calibration (mini_calibration) run, channel 141 corrected.

Run2: channel 383 to 387, mannings N increase to 0.028
      (tried 0.026 first, not enough to divert flow from steamboat sl into Sac River).

Run3: channel 423 to 429, Mannings N decrease to 0.03
      to divert more to Sac from Steamboat Sl. and increase amplitude of RSAC123

run4: channel 379 to 382, N increase to 0.028.
      (also effective in diverting flow to Sac river) 

run5: channel 422, N change to 0.03. not effective. DCC and Geogianna Sl still low.

run6: Channel 422 to 429, Mannings N change back to 0.032.( not good, less water in SAc)

run7: Channle 379 to 387, N increase to 0.031.(very good, RSAC128,Rsac123 match exactly)

Following runs try to match, jersey Point, three mile sl flow amplitudes:

run8: Channel 307 to 310, N decrease to 0.028 (increase three mile slough flow amplitude, very good)

run9: Channel 48 to 53, 83, 281 to 286, 295 to 300 change to 0.025 (281 o 286)

run10: Try clean up, all channels (48 to 53, 83, 281 to 301 except 290,291) 
       leading to Jersey Point are set to 0.024. three mile sl to 0.030

run11: run10 change to 0.026

run12: three mile sl to 0.032. result looks good at three mile sl, jersey point, and geogianna sl. 
       ONly ROLD024 amplitude is small.

switch to WY2008. 
run12:...
run13: change all 0.027 to 0.0251 to increase ROLD024 amplitude. 
       Compares with old calibration better, doesnot match positive peaks. 

run14: increase channel 511, 512, 513, 515 manning's n to 0.02, to reduce flow Magnitude of SLMZU025.

run15: change all 69 channels of 0.018 to 0.020.

run16: change all channel of 0.02 to 0.021, change ch 430 to 434 back to 0.018 
       because of amplitude of Sltrm003 and RSAC101.
       
       Write status report for CWEFT presentation. Use run 16 to compare with mini_calibration, 
       because no channel changes were made until run16.

run17: channel 144 not good, delete two larger cross sections.

run18: deleted.
**********
run19: changed hydro to NAVD88 including all channel, gates, reservoir, operating rule, init stage. 
       (channel 117 minor modify to avoid negative dConveyance) 
       flow results compare well with NGVD29 run. pass test. 
       use NAVD88 from now on 2/1/2012
      
delete run20: try to find way to improve min daily stage:  
       Manning's n increase when stage low, helped min daily stage to increase about o.2 ft.

delete run21: try area adjustment near collinsville, see if the min stage can be improved. 
       not obvious, almost no change.

delete run22: try increase bathymetry 1ft from run19. min daily stage increase less than 0.2 ft.  

delete run23: restart, output downstream channels to see phase pattern.
       try channel 430---436, 290,291 increase n to 0.02

delete run24: base on run20 base. try reduce 379-387, 422-429 mannings n. DLC shape better.
       try increase DCC coefficient to 1.0, flow much better.
       
run20: reorganize into 36 groups for easy Mannings N adjustment. 
       Preliminary calibration result with NAVD88 datum. 

run21: channel 348,349, n changed to 0.026, helped a lot with LPS, LPS matches much better. 

run22: modify channel 279, get rid of the first two small XS (match better 6/23/2002 to 7/7/2002).
       modify channel 280 (Fishermans cut) with new XS, also increase n to 0.05. 
       add taylor slough output.

run23: Change group Franks_tract to 0.027 to compare flow in taylor sl.
       taylor Sl is still high, change only 271, 272 taylor Sl to 0.05, 
       the discharge reduced to around +1000,-1000.

run24: regroup according to Dutch (0.025), Sand mond, piper sl (0.027), 
       Manning's n kept the same as run23.
       (* channel 273 put into group Sandmound_sl, I think this is better)
 
delete run25: try delete the large XS at 270. taylor sl flow shifted downward.
       try also 273 to 0.025, made taylor sl flow magnitude higher both negative and positive flows.
       so no improvement in this test. Abandon.

run25: try improve HWB, and MOK, RSAC128 negative flow. 
       388,389,390 n change from 0.034 to 0.029.
       sutter sl 375 to 382, n change from 0.027 to 0.029, HWB better. 
       Although net flow still low, but range higher              

run26: try MOK, RSAC128 negative flow. 
       channel 348, 349 change from 0.026 to 0.028, LPS a little better.
       channel 365 change from 0.022 to 0.028, to be more consistent with other channels.
       DLC gate coefficient change to 2.0 to allow more flow through the gates. 
       (Higher coefficients tested, small improvement with 3.0, not used)
       
stop here.
