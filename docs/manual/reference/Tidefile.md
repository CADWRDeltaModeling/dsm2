# Tidefile

## Overview

The tidefile is the HDF5-formatted binary file used to pass flow and
geometry date from HYDRO to QUAL and PTM. The tidefile is specified as
output by HYDRO in the
<a href="https://dwrnpmsweb0110/io_file.html" rel="nofollow">IO_FILE</a>
table. It is specified as input to QUAL and PTM in the TIDEFILE section.
Input tidefiles can be specified only in text.

Tidefiles can be stacked if desired, but this is an old feature that is
now deprecated. Stacking means that the flow simulation can be divided
temporally among several HYDRO runs and then the resulting tidefiles
used sequentially in QUAL or PTM.

## Tables

**Example**

``` text
TIDEFILE     
START_DATE END_DATE FILENAME   
runtime    length   ${HYDROTIDEFILE} # begin run to 20JUL  
END 
```

The following example uses one tidefile with an environmental variable
for the file name. This is the most treatment.

**Example**

``` text
TIDEFILE     




START_DATE  END_DATE   FILENAME   
runtime     20JUL1996  hist1.h5      # beginning of run to 20JUL  
20JUL1996   24JUL1996  hist2.h5   
last        length     hist3.h5      # end of previous to end of run  
01SEP1996   length     ficticious.h5 # no error: will never be opened   
END 
```

This example uses several tidefiles tiled together to cover a longer
period. Please let us know if you need this functionality, as it is a
holdover from the old "repeating tide" days and will probably be
deprecated.

  

#### Field Descriptions

##### START_DATE

When to start using the tidefile. Tidefiles must be listed in temporal
order. The START_DATE of the first tidefile must fall on or before the
start of the run. The START_DATE of subsequent tidefiles must exactly
coincide with the END_DATES of preceding tidefiles. There is no
associated "TIIME" part == tidefiles must be matched on calendar days.
If a START_DATE is not given or is listed as "none", the timestamp in
the tidefile will be used for the start. There are some special
keywaords that can be used with START_DATE:

-   runtime: start time in tidefile
-   last: use this tidefile when the previous tidefile ends
-   none: use default.

##### END_DATE

When to stop using the tidefile. IF not given, the tidefile is used
until it ends. The END_DATE of the last tidefile must overlap the
runtime of the simulation. Note that this can be a little tricky because
the ending time is the time 0000 of the END_DATE, so you may need
another day. You can avoid this sort of problem by specifying your run
dates with standard times (0000Â  instead of military 2400). There are
some special keywords that can be used with END_DATE:

-   length: use all of the tidefile, up until its end
-   none: use default.

##### FILENAME

Name of the file. Use upper/lower case consistently because filenames
are case sensitive.

#### Table Info

##### Identifier:

FILENAME

ENVVARs are often used for names of files, DSS paths, parameters that
are varied over a study -- the substitution will occur at runtime.
