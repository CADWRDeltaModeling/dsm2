# DSM2

## Overview:

The Delta Simulation Model II (DSM2) is a one-dimensional mathematical
model for dynamic simulation of one-dimensional hydrodynamics, water
quality and particle tracking in a network of riverine or estuarine
channels. DSM2 can calculate stages, flows, velocities, mass transport
processes for conservative and non-conservative constituents including
salts, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and trihalomethane formation
potential, and transport of individual particles. DSM2 thus provides a
powerful simulation package for analysis of complex hydrodynamic, water
quality, and ecological conditions in riverine and estuarine systems.

DSM2 currently consists of three modules, all of which come with the
current distribution: HYDRO, QUAL, and PTM. HYDRO simulates
one-dimensional hydrodynamics including flows, velocities, depth, and
water surface elevations. HYDRO provides the flow input for QUAL and
PTM. QUAL simulates one-dimensional fate and transport of conservative
and non-conservative water quality constituents given a flow field
simulated by HYDRO. PTM simulates pseudo 3-D transport of neutrally
buoyant particles based on the flow field simulated by HYDRO. PTM has
multiple applications ranging from visualization of flow patterns to
simulation of discrete organisms such as fish eggs and larvae.

DSM2 is currently in version 8.2.2. Please send comments to Min Yu
