# Background Material and References

DSM2 Hydro is based on the FourPt computer program written by Lew DeLong in USGS. The original documentation for FourPt is
available [here](../attachments/87229010/87229015.pdf). DSM2 adds improvements and enhancements to the FourPt model, including
an improved input and output system.

  

DSM2 Qual is roughly based on [QUAL-2E](../attachments/87229010/87229009.pdf)
 and the [Branched Langrangian
Transport Model](../attachments/87229010/87229014.pdf) (BLTM) written by Harvey Jacobson of USGS.Â
