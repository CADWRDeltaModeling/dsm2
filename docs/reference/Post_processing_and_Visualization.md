# Post processing and Visualization

DSM2 writes out model information in HEC-DSS format and HDF5 format.
Output requested from the model is written to HEC-DSS while model input
and state is recorded in HDF5 files.

  

Vista is the standard tool for accessing both these kinds of information
for DSS. Vscript is the associated scripting tool which leverages the
Python language with the HEC-DSS and HDF5 java libraries.
