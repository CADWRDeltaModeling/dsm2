# Planning Simulation Checklist

# **Model Preparation**

Get Input Data from Calsim

-   Rename Calsim output as dv.dss and put in timeseries\CALSIM\\
-   Preprocess Calsim output to DSM2 inputs

Check Boundary Conditions

-   Sacramento River inflow
-   San Joaquin River Inflow
-   Sacramento River + Yolo Bypass Inflow
-   Banks pumping
-   Jones pumping

Martinez Stage

-   Planning stage
-   Sea Level Rise stage ()

Martinez EC

-   Martinez EC generator

Consumptive Usage

-   DCD planning (which is also input for Calsim3)

Gate Operation

-   DCC
-   Montezuma Gate
-   Clifton Court Forebay Gate

  

# **Model Run**

Binary Versions

-   suggest using relative path and .bat

Running Time Window

-   16-year: 1975/10 - 1991/9
-   94-year:Â 1975/10 - 1991/9
-   start a few months earlier for warming-up
