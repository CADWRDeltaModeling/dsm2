# DSM2 Sacramento San-Joaquin Delta Grid

## Introduction

The main area of application for DSM2 is the Sacramento San-Joaquin Delta. This grid has been developed over the years. A commonly used version is available as a [PDF](attachments/87228652/87228654.pdf).

## ArcGIS Version

In recent years, Jane Schafer-Kramer created an [ArcGIS version of this grid](attachments/87228652/87228653.mpk). This map representation will be refined and made available with the ArcGIS X-section editing tool, which is now in beta testing.

To view channels colored by Manning's or dispersion, `channels.inp` was imported (from DSM2 v8.1.2) as a table. This was then joined with the "DSM2 Channels" table in ArcGIS on the channel number field. Symbology can then be used to display the Manning's attribute in the joined table.
