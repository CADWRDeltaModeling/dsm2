# Exporting Channel Lengths from CSDP Network File

CSDP can output just the channel IDs and lengths.

1. Use the `Network > Export Options` menu item to select only channel lengths output in station elevation format.
2. Then use the `Network > Save As` menu to save the file, which will contain only the channel ID and length in the output.
