# Documentation

## Overview:

Welcome to DSM2. This documentation is an ever-developing effort to get
you started using the model. In learning DSM2 you will want to make use
of the following resources

-   The tutorials, which will get you used to the user interface and
    running the model. There are two major groups of tutorials: one
    builds up a simplified model from the channels to boundaries to
    operating rules. Its instructions are very explicit. The second
    group of how-to tutorials focuses on large practical problems,
    examples of real studies on the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.
-   The documentation. This documentation explains how to use the
    graphical and text input of the model.
-   Fellow modelers and water managers.

## Data management

Input data for DSM2 is managed using a combination of a relational
database with a graphical interface for tabular input, HEC-DSS for time
series storage and a small amount of text inputs for frequently-changing
components of the model.

There is a section in this documentation for each input table. There is
also a section for each type of text input. The two do not overlap,
except for scalars (text is a last minute opportunity to change a
scalar) and output (you can add output in text).

## User Interface

The DSM2 database interface is shown below. Important nomenclature is
identified -- the terms in this figure are used freuently in this
documentation.
