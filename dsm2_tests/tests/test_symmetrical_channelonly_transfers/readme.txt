Tests for an asymmetry in a linear chain of channels from node 1 - 6 by changing the flow, ec boundary
from 1 to 6. Furthermore there is a transfer from the nodes next to the boundaries , the direction 
of which is also flipped between the symmetrical cases.

Checks are done to make sure that flow, stage and ec match between the appropriate symmetrical points
in both cases.
