This is the EC calibration note for V8.1Beta
Start with Hydro run 26. 
Time step using 15/30/15 for Hydro/Tidefile/Qual.

EC_run1: Start with 2009 Mini-Calibration, scale dispersion coefficients by 1200, i.e. DC=1200*DQQ. 
         Results good at West Delta upto until RSAC081, RSAN007.
	 (MTZ EC converted to 15min instant using HECDSS view, 
         by shift hourly data -30min first, then convert to 15min. 
         Result almost identical to correctly using hourly data with per_aver property.)

EC_run2: try to increase channel 434, 435 10% to 660. RSAC092 increase 3%.

EC_run3: test 3mile sl 309 310, 308 307 increase 100% to 360.  no effect on EC. abandon.

         increase 434 435 to 0.7*1200=840, RSAC092 much higher, match better. 
         RSAN007 and RSAN018 also get higher.
            
EC_run4: Change channel 279, 280 DC to 720. results have small changes, good. 
         Get rid of outliers for regression analysis for Clifton_court, ROLD024, SLDUT009 
         December 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, Aug, Sep 2008, Jan at 2001, 
         when the model failed to predict the EC peaks.
         RSAN018, Rold024 are a little high.

EC_run5: reduce 0.07*1200=84 to 0.05*1200=60 for channels 48--53, 284,...
         a little better at RSAN018 (slope reduced from 1.09 to 1.07), 
         Overall results still high.

EC_run6: try reduce overall by 2%. results matches data better.

EC_run7: copy from run5, but with only limited modifications to west delta by roughly 2%. 
         1560 to 1530 (channel 439,440,452), 
         960 to 940 (channel 437, 438, 452), 
         360 to 350 (channel 290,291 436). 
         Result very close to run6. 
         Update DC in hydro echo input file and tested fine.  
         *This is my last calibration at 9/12/12 before vacation. 
         
EC_run8: copy from Run7, run with new 3x faster Hydro. Enching's Qual. 
         My compiled Qual has the same results but slower.
 
EC_run9_MTZ15minAve: Martinez EC change to 15min per-ave, 
         compare to 1hr per-ave EC, the differences are surprisingly small about 0.1%.
         only looks better at RSAC054 with 15min. 1hr step looks rough.
         compare to run8, lower, but maximum diffrence near west Delta is less than 1%. Clifton court only 0.2%.
         will continue with this setup using 15min per-ave. (or may use original hourly averaged data)
         *the model did't handle instantaneous/linear very well due to the explicit scheme. 
         So not recommend using ins/linear for quality.
         *all channel volume conservation was checked in Qual using the 8yr run, 
         Accumulated error/difference is less than 0.01%.

EC_run10_MTZ_EC_correct_after_10-1-2002: 
         correct MTZ EC: Before 10-1-2002, the data were from IEP, they are indeed hourly averaged. 
         But after 10/1/2002, CDEC hourly data were used, which were instant samples, not hourly averaged. 
         Convert ins hourly data to per-aver using HEC-DssVue for data after 10/1/2002.

EC_run11_beta_release: update time series to 3/2012 for beta release 
         and use Lan's latest Oprule changes, clifton Gate operation corrections. 
         also convert the hydro echo input file to the original model input setup.
