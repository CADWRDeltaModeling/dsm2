(Intentional) Differences between JNumeric and CNumeric

* There is no multiarray module.
* umath is a submodule of the Numeric package.
* Ones acts like zeros if no typecode is given instead of defaulting to Int.
* array no longer supports copy=0/1 keyword argument.
* Int refers to native (Int32) int type rather than largest (Int64) type.
* a[0] doesn't work for zeros sized arrays -- use a[()] or a[...].
* I think CNumerics convolve has an off-by-one error.
* Some of the unfuncs that should have been returning ints, returned 
types that matched their arguments (logical_and for example). Also,
some of the documented ufuncs are missing from CNumeric.
*div/mod: These behave like the underlying C functions, not like
Python's div/mod operators. I've kept this behaviour (it was easier),
but I reserve the right to change it in the future.
* Changed the behaviour of dot. Now dot acts on axis -1/0 by default,
since it now accepts two axes arguments, this is not as big a deal as it once
was.
* Diagonal now takes only one axis argument (diagonal is taken on axis, axis+1).
  I couldn't figure out a way to make sense of using two nonadjacent axes, and the
  python code was broken for axes != (-2,-1) anyway.
