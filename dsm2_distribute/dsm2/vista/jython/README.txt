Welcome to Jython 2.5.0
=======================

This is the final release of the 2.5.0 version of Jython and brings us up to
language level compatibility with the 2.5 version of CPython.  This release has
had a strong focus on CPython compatibility, and so this release of Jython can
run more pure Python apps then any previous release.  Please see the NEWS file
for detailed release notes.

The release was compiled on Mac OS X with JDK 5 and requires JDK 5 to run.

Please try this out and report any bugs at http://bugs.jython.org.
