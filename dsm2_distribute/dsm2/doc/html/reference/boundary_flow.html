<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>Boundary Flows are boundary conditions at nodes where flow is 
known. This view defines these time series and assigns time series data
to them.
</p>

<a name="tables"></a>
<h2 id="tables">Tables:</h2>
<a name="boundary_flow_table"></a>
<h3 class="table_name">BOUNDARY_FLOW</h3>
<p>The Boundary Flow table defines flow boundary conditions by giving
them names and associating them with a node. The table also assigns a 
time series to the boundary condition. Boundary Flow is a top-level layered table. 
</p>
<h4 class="field_def_title">Field Descriptions</h4>
<dl class="field_definitions">
<dt>NAME</dt>
<dd>Name assigned to the source. This is the
identifier of the boundary and is referred to elsewhere in the
input system. If you assign water quality you
will use the same name in order to match concentration to flow.</dd>
<dt>NODE</dt>
<dd>Node number at which the source is applied.</dd>
<dt>SIGN</dt><dd>Forces the time series to be a source or a sink. Positive values are
normally associated with a source, but the data (especially sinks such as agricultural 
diversions) are sometimes measured in absolute flow. Use 1 to force the value to be a 
positive source or -1 to interpret values as a sink. </dd>
<dt>FILLIN</dt><dd>Method for filling in data if the time step of the assigned series
is coarser than the time step of the model. 
See <a href="../definitions/fillin.html">fillin types</a></dd>
<dt>FILE</dt><dd>DSS or text file in which data are stored. Use consistent
case when referring to the same file. You may also enter the word <em>constant</em>
if you would like to assign a constant value to the input (the value will be
entered in the next column).</dd>
<dt>PATH</dt>
<dd>The path within the text or DSS file of the time series data.
If you used the <em>constant</em> keyword in the Input File
column, enter the value (e.g. <em>4.22</em>) here.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Usage Notes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Multiple sources and sinks can be assigned to a node. They are usually kept separate
in order to assign different concentrations to them. </li>
<li>HYDRO is able to accept sources and sinks at boundary nodes, but this
is not good modeling practice. Use them on the interior.</li>
</ul>
