Usage Notes


- Eliminate the pictures of the GUI
- Rename the file (using SVN) to change
  GUI:  channel_view.html becomes channel_input.html (view becomes input)
  text: io_file_text_input becomes io_file_input.html (drop the file part)
- Add examples (the text references have table formatting you can use as an example) after each table
- In the titles use CHANNEL input instead of Channel View or CHANNEL Section. We are grouping by parent table.
