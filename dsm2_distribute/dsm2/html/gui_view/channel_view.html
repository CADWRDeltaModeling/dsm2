<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>Channels are the fundamental objects of the DSM2 grid. The Channels View 
of the GUI allows you to enter channel connectivity, parameters and geometry. 
Channels connectivity is defined by an upstream and downstream node numbers 
of the channels. Two child tables in the Channels View describe the locations and geometry
of user-described cross-sections in the selected channel. Note that a default initial condition is
required for every channel number in the DSM2 grid, and this is entered seperately in the
Channel Initial Conditions View.</p>

<h3 class="table_name">Channel Table</h3>
<p>Channel table defines the connectivity, length, friction and
dispersion characteristics of a channel. The channel table is a
top-level layered table.</p>

<h3 class="table_name">Channel Cross Section Table</h3>
<p>This table lists locations where bathymetric
cross-sections are specified by the user. The table lists the fraction of the distance
along the reach (from upstream to downstream) at which the user
cross-section is located. These cross-sections will be interpolated by
the model at computational points. Overspecification of geometry is a 
frequent source of user error/misconception, 
please see <a href="#usage">usage notes</a> below</p>

<a name="xsect_layer_table"></a>
<h3 class="table_name">Cross Section Layer Table</h3>
<p>The Cross-Section Layer Table lists geometric information
about each cross-section. This information is in the form of lookup
tables of hydraulically important quantities such as area, width and
wetted perimeter.</p>
<h4 class="field_def_title">Field Descriptions</h4>

<dt>Elevation</dt><dd>Elevation from bottom at which properties are known. The area, width, etc. apply to this elevation, and channel properties between elevations are linearly interpolated.</dd>
<dt>Width</dt><dd>Width of channel at top (ft).</dd>
<dt>Area</dt><dd>Area of channel from bottom to cross section(sq ft). Ignored if Area disagrees at high precision with the integral of Width.</dd>
<dt>Wetted Perimeter</dt><dd>Wetted perimeter of channel at given elevation.</dd>

<h2>Usage Notes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>All channels must have an initial condition and at least one cross-section.</li>
<li>Older versions of DSM2 had the notion of a "regular" cross-section (meaning rectangular). In the current DSM2 this is just a cross-section with two layers. </li>
<li>Users frequently overspecificy cross-sections, either by specifying 
more cross-sections longitudinally than the model can possibly use 
or by describing cross-sections vertically in such a way as to capture highly local features
such as small constrictions, sills and undulations. DSM2 is commonly used with spatial resolution (delta x)
of several thousand feet. You should only include features that are well resolved by this resolution, which means
changes that persist over several miles. Even more importantly, you should avoid adjacent cross-sections with bottoms
that vary greatly in elevation because they can cause odd behavior when cross-sections are interpolated to
computation points. The bottoms layers of cross sections should represent the "overall" slope of the channel.</li>
<li>Tools are available for importing cross-sections from CSDP. However, you should be aware
of the accuracy problem in CSDP -- the cross-section area reported by this program is 
not accurate, and is therefore ignored by DSM2 which recalculates area by integrating width.</li>
</ul>
