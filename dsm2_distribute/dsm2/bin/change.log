DSM2_v8.0 beta 1 changes (from 8.0 alpha):

1.  Fixed the corrupt file name in the PTM echo file.
2.  Removed the absolute value conversion for boundary flow input. After this change, 
    if sign = 1 means the boundary flow is multiplied by 1, and if sign = -1
    means the boundary flow is multiplied by -1.
