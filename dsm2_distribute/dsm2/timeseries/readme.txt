This empty directory is for reusable time series.

Generally you will want to put your large historical dss files here.
It is also where time series frequently used in preprocessing are stored.

Generally speaking, other than one sample for testing, you won't want to put
CalSim output here. The CalSim output (input to our preprocessors) can go in the
study directory in a local /timeseries directory or a different location entirely.

The preprocessed Calsim data (output of our preprocessors usually goes in
the study folder in a local /timeseries directory.
