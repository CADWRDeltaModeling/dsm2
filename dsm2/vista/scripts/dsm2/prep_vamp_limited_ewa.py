    Script specifically for studies with limited EWA. This

    in CALSIM. It retrieves the pulse and non-pulse info from CALSIM,
    and then prepares a consolidated path with both.
    
    The script is based on prep_vamp.py, and handles CVP using routines
    from that file. The special treatment here is for SWP.
