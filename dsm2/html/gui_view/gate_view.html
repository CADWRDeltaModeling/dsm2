<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p><i>Gates</i> are sites that present a barrier or control on flow. 
A gate may have an arbitrary number of associated hydraulic devices (pipes and weirs), 
each of which may be operated independently to control flow.</p>

<p>The Gates View is primarily for specifying the physical properties of the gate and
some simple operating modes. Gates that are operated simply can be completely specified in this
view of the GUI. Much more elaborate controls are possible using Gate Time Series and Operating Rules, 
and in addition to manipulating the hydraulic devices you can completely uninstall the
gate.</p>

<a name="device_table"></a>
<h3 class="table_name">Gate Device Table</h3>
<p>This table lists hydraulic structures that exist at the gate site to control flow. Currently pipes and weirs
are supported. In this table, the user specifies physical properties of the device as well as
default operations. Both employ the following formulas depending on whether the water surface is higher on the 
water body or node side of the gate:</p>
<math>
<p>Q = nC<sub>op_to</sub>C<sub>to</sub>A(z<sub>wb</sub>, p)<em> sqrt</em>[ 2g(z<sub>wb</sub> - z<sub>node</sub>) ]       ... z<sub>wb</sub> > z<sub>node</sub>
<p>Q = nC<sub>op_from</sub>C<sub>from</sub>A(z<sub>node</sub>, p)<em> sqrt</em>[ 2g(z<sub>node</sub> - z<sub>wb</sub>) ] ... z<sub>wb</sub> < z<sub>node</sub>
</math>
<p>Where: 
<ul><li>n is the number of duplicate devices></li>
<li>C<sub>op_to</sub> and C<sub>op_to</sub> are operating coefficient representing controls such as flap gates</li>
<li>C<sub>to</sub> and C<sub>from</sub> are coefficients
representing the hydraulic efficiency of the gate</li>
<li>A is the area of flow depending on higher water surface and position p</li>
<li>g is gravity and </li> 
<li>z<sub>wb</sub> and z<sub>node</sub> are the water surface elevations at the water body and node (node surface is assessed by means of a reference channel that has no gates attached to it).
</ul>

<h4 class="field_def_title">Field Descriptions</h4>
<dl class="field_definitions">
<dt>Name</dt><dd>Name of the device. This is the identifier refered to in other tables.</dd>
<dt>Structure</dt><dd>Type of hydraulic structure (pipe/weir) represented by the device.</dd>
<dt># Duplicates</dt><dd>Number of exact duplicates, such as a number of similar pipes in parallel.
Parameters such as width apply to a single one of the duplicates.</dd>
<dt>Radius/Width</dt><dd>Maximum width of the device (radius of a pipe, width of a weir).</dd>
<dt>Elev</dt><dd>Invert elevation or weir crest. </dd>
<dt>Height</dt><dd>Height of the device from the invert elevation. This can be used to represent the height of 
rectangular flashboards or of a radial gate. If the surface goes above this height, flow will be submerged.
Use NA for an open top. If you click in an NA column, you
will see that it is encoded using a large number, but you should only use 'NA' or a real height.</dd>
<dt>CF To Node</dt><dd>Flow coefficient of the gate (0 < C<sub>to</sub> <= 1.0) describing the efficiency of the gate
from water body to node. This parameter is the physical coefficient of flow. It should never be zero and 
should not be used to describe a control structure or operation such as flap gates or gate openings.</dd>
<dt>CF From Node</dt><dd>Same as CF To Node, but for the direction from node to water body.
</dd>
<dt>Default Op</dt><dd>Default operation mode. The gate operation is a "magic" parameter
between 0.0 and 1.0 that modulates gate flow. Operating coefficients can be used to represent flap gates, fractions of duplicates operating or
other physical controls. The default ops are simple on this table are like initial conditions -- if 
you want more sophisticated control you will need to use a Gate Time Series or Operating Rule.
Nevertheless, the defaults are enough to represent structures that
are fully open or closed or operated unidirectionally. Here is how the default operation mode
will affect the operating coefficient:
<dl>
<dt>gate_open</dt><dd>C<sub>op_to</sub>=1.0; C<sub>op_from</sub>=1.0;</dd>
<dt>gate_close</dt><dd>C<sub>op_to</sub>=0.0; C<sub>op_from</sub>=0.0;</dd>
<dt>unidir_to</dt><dd>C<sub>op_to</sub>=1.0; C<sub>op_from</sub>=0.0;</dd>
<dt>unidir_from</dt><dd>C<sub>op_to</sub>=0.0; C<sub>op_from</sub>=1.0;</dd>
</dd>
<dt>Position Control</dt><dd>This variable specifies the type of gate control stucture and thus how the gate responds to the
"position" variable in time series or operating rules.  Options included no gate, gated from top down
(as in a typical radial gate, in which case position controls "height") or gated from bottom (as in the permanent gate design, in 
which case position controls "elev").  This input is now deprecated -- it is now possible to control elev or height directly in the time series
or operating rule.</dd>

<h2>Usage Notes:</h2>
Several types of time series and operational controls can be placed on gates.
<math><sqrt>z<sub>1</sub></sqrt></math>
<ul>
<li>At least one channel at every node must be ungated.</li>
<li>Gates can be removed using an operation rule that sets the gates <em>install</em> variable
to zero. Gates that are uninstalled behave like normal nodes with equal water surface constraints
between them. Operations and time series that manipulate the device operating coefficients and
positions will be applied, but the devices will be totally ignored in computations to
determine flow.
flow.</li>
<li>Gates can be controlled by a number of variables that are time-varying and controlled by time series
or operating rules:
<dl>
<dt><em>install</em> </dt><dd>Install applies to the whole gate, not individual devices. When the gate is uninstalled (install=0)
the gate ceases to exist, none of its devices are applied (although the continue to exist in the background).
The gate is totally replaced by an equal-stage compatibility condition. </dd>
<dt><em>op_to_node</em> </dt><dd>Operating coefficient in the direction from water body to node.</dd>
<dt><em>op_from_node</em> </dt><dd>Operating coefficient in the direction from node to water body.</dd>
<dt><em>op</em> </dt><dd>Operating coefficient in both directions. This is just a convenience combo
of the individual to/from node versions. It is write-only in operating rules, because it combines
two variables and there is no single value that can be read.</dd>
<dt><em>position</em> </dt><dd>Physical operating position whose interpretation depends on the Position Control
setting of the gate device. This is now deprecated in favor of more direct manipulation of things like gate elevation.</dd>
<dt><em>elev</em> </dt><dd>Weir crest or pipe invert elevation. This can represent evolution over time or a bottom-operating structure.</dd>
<dt><em>width</em> </dt><dd>Weir width or pipe radius. This usually represents evolution over time.</dd>
<dt><em>height</em> </dt><dd>Weir gate height, width of a flashboard. This can represent evolution over time or a top-operating structure like a radial gate.</dd>
<dd></dd>
