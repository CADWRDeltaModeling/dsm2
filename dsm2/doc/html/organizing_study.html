<h3>Explaining the directory structure</h3>

<dd>A study is an associated group of simulations, which might involve
any combination of DSM2 modules. Often the study compares several different alternatives.
Many DSM2 modelers prefer to house different alternatives in different folders, but
there are good reasons to house them in one study folder and just use different 
configuration files. To get started you will typically copy one of the study_template
sub-directories to the /study folder. Don't change the ones in study_templates!</dd>

<p>You can arrange things any way you want, but this section will give 
 some hints about how studies get organized.</p>
 
 a simulation is a package of related model
 runs with compatible geometry and flow input. 
 A simulation always includes a DSM2-HYDRO model run 
 to establish a flow field. Optionally, it may also contain one or more
 water quality and particle tracking models. The models are not
 tightly coupled -- flow data is transfered from
 HYDRO to QUAL or PTM through a file called a <em>tidefile</em>.</p>

 <p>A <em>model</em> is one computer 
 model component of a simulation, the input for one DSM2-HYDRO, QUAL
 or PTM run.  If there is a simulation described as <em>planning</em> 
 there might models called <em>planning_hydro</em>, 
 <em>planning_qual_ec</em> and <em>planning_qual_do</em>
 that describe hydrodynamic and water quality models that would 
 be launched independently.</p>

<p>Simulations and models are containers. The actual data 
 such as channels, gates or boundary conditions are grouped in sets called 
 <em>layers</span>. Layers are a means of grouping like components.
 The layering system is described in more detail in the 
 <a href="layers.html">Layers</a> documentation</p>
