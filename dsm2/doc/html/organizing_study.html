<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>The DSM2 installation directory is as follows:
<div class="fragment">
<pre class="fragment">
/dsm2
  /bin            # where the executable files are
  /common_input   # a repository of common input files
  /studies
     [empty]      # DO YOUR WORK HERE (if inside the distribution)
  /study_templates    # ...and NOT here
     /historical
     /ocap_sdip
        config_ocap_sdip.inp
        hydro.inp
        qual_ec.inp
        /timeseries
  /timeseries     # Archivable time series (historical
                  # and series used as basis for preprocessing)
  /tutorials
</pre>
</div>
<h3>Explaining the directory structure</h3>
<dl class="field_definitions">
<dt>bin</dt>
<dd>"Bin" stands for "binary" and refers to the executables. When you installed dsm2, your path variable got set to the new distribution.
<dt>common_input</dt>
<dd>The common input directory is a repository of files that are used in the standard
templates. These files start with the name of the (parent) object, then the "layer" name then the version date. The templates refer to this directory often. You do not have to maintain these links, but please do not edit the files... the <a href="layers.html">Layering</a> system should help with this.</dd>
<dt>study_templates</dt>
<dd>This directory houses samples for historical and planning runs. They represent our latest setup as of the distribution. As the templates are updated they may point to newer files in <em>common_input</em>.
</dd>
<dt>studies</dt>
<dd>A study is an associated group of simulations, which might involve
any combination of DSM2 modules. Often the study compares several different alternatives.
Many DSM2 modelers prefer to house different alternatives in different folders, but
there are good reasons to house them in one study folder and just use different 
configuration files. To get started you will typically copy one of the study_template
sub-directories to the /study folder. Don't change the ones in study_templates!</dd>

<dt>timeseries</dt><dd>The <em>timeseries</em> directory contains the timeseries you will need in the regular course of working with DSM2. Since the data that are most reusable are historical and DICU, that is most of what you will find here. We don't recommend putting study-specific files (e.g. CALSIM output) in this directory.</dd>
<dt>tutorials</dt><dd>The <em>tutorials</em> directory is a workspace for using the tutorials. It is a lot like /studies in the sense that you will copy templates here.</dd>
