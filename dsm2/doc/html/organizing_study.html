<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>Within the database, DSM2 projects are grouped into 
simulations and models. The <em>simulation</em>
 is the top level organizational structure in DSM2: when
 you open up the user interface (GUI), the first thing you will do is
 open, clone or create a simulation. </p>
 <p>Organizationally, a simulation is a package of related model
 runs with compatible geometry and flow input. 
 A simulation always includes a DSM2-HYDRO model run 
 to establish a flow field. Optionally, it may also contain one or more
 water quality and particle tracking models. The models are not
 tightly coupled -- flow data is transfered from
 HYDRO to QUAL or PTM through a file called a <em>tidefile</em>.</p>

 <p>A <em>model</em> is one computer 
 model component of a simulation, the input for one DSM2-HYDRO, QUAL
 or PTM run.  If there is a simulation described as <em>planning</em> 
 there might models called <em>planning_hydro</em>, 
 <em>planning_qual_ec</em> and <em>planning_qual_do</em>
 that describe hydrodynamic and water quality models that would 
 be launched independently.</p>

<p>Simulations and models are containers. The actual data 
 such as channels, gates or boundary conditions are grouped in sets called 
 <em>layers</span>. Layers are a means of grouping like components.
 The layering system is described in more detail in the 
 <a href="layers.html">Layers</a> documentation</p>
