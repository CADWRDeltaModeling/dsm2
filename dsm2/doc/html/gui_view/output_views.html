<h2>Overview:</h2>
<p>There are several Output Views in the GUI. They assign
HEC-DSS or text output requests to model locations at channels,
reservoirs, gates and nodes. The output requests are equivalent to
those made in the OUTPUTPATHS section of the text input.
The database is the preferred place for logically coherent groups of
frequently-needed output -- for instance "sdip_output_qual" or
"std_hydro_rki" are layers that are available in the database. On the
other hand, quick diagnostic or run-specific output should be entered
in the text files, especially if adding such output would lead to a new
simulation in the database just for
non-archivable items such as output.

<a name="output_table"></a><h3 class="table_name">Output Table</h3>
<p>Each Output View has an Output Table. The table is a top-level
layered table. The table specifies the name for output request,
location, variable being output, time aggregation and destination file.</p>

depend on the model feature being output.

number and optional distance. Variables are stage, flow, velocity 
and constituent names.</dd>
<dt>Reservoir</dt><dd>Reservoir name and (where applicable)
node number of connection. Variables are flow (connection must be supplied),
stage and flow-net.</dd>
<dt>Gate</dt><dd>Gate name and optional device name. Variables are install or flow (no device specified),
width, elev, height, op-to-node, op-from-node, position, device-flow (all of which require a device to be specified).  </dd>
<dt>Node</dt><dd>Node Number. Node output is never recommended . There are no model variables that exist at nodes
 -- see <a href="usage">usage notes</a>). If you do use output at nodes, note that the output will average across 
 incoming flows (this set may change over the tide cycle).</dd>

<h2>Usage Notes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finer output is preferred to daily.  You can easily average to daily later outside the 
model using a script or time series application.
Tidal data are very poorly represented by daily results, and numerous incorrect conclusions have arisen 
from aliasing when this inherantly-24 hour operation is imposed on a 25-hour phenomenon. 
Monthly output was disabled from DSM2 because it was not well trusted and hard to maintain as a black box within the model.</li>
<li>Avoid output at nodes. This output is included for backward compatibility. There is no data at nodes
in the computational model and node-based output misrepresents this point.</li>
</ul>
