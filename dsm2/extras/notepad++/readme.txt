This file contains Notepad++ language support for DSM2.

The file should either be installed in your application data folder, e.g.:

C:\Documents and Settings\myusername\Application Data\Notepad++

or, if you told Notepad not to use this folder when you installed it, in:

C:\Program Files\Notepad++

Either way, you should find an old one. 


**** If you have already defined a user language you will have to merge them manually ****
