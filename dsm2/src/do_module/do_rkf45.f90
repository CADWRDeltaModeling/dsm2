!    RKF45 is primarily designed to solve non-stiff and mildly stiff
!    differential equations when derivative evaluations are inexpensive.
!    RKF45 should generally not be used when the user is demanding
!    high accuracy.
!
!  Abstract:
!
!    RKF45 integrates a system of NEQN first order ordinary differential
!    equations of the form:
!
!      dY(i)/dT = F(T,Y(1),Y(2),...,Y(NEQN))
!
!    where the Y(1:NEQN) are given at T.
!
!    Typically the subroutine is used to integrate from T to TOUT but it
!    can be used as a one-step integrator to advance the solution a
!    single step in the direction of TOUT.  On return, the parameters in
!    the call list are set for continuing the integration.  The user has
!    only to call RKF45 again (and perhaps define a new value for TOUT).
!    Actually, RKF45 is an interfacing routine which calls subroutine
!    RKFS for the solution.  RKFS in turn calls subroutine FEHL which
!    computes an approximate solution over one step.

!
!
!  first call
!
!    The user must provide storage in his calling program for the arrays
!    in the call list  -      y(neqn) , work(3+6*neqn) , iwork(5)  ,
!    declare f in an external statement, supply subroutine f(t,y,yp) and
!    initialize the following parameters-
!
!      neqn -- number of equations to be integrated.  (neqn >= 1)
!
!      y(*) -- vector of initial conditions
!
!      t -- starting point of integration , must be a variable
!
!      tout -- output point at which solution is desired.
!            t=tout is allowed on the first call only, in which case
!            rkf45 returns with iflag=2 if continuation is possible.
!
!      relerr,abserr -- relative and absolute local error tolerances
!            which must be non-negative. relerr must be a variable while
!            abserr may be a constant. the code should normally not be
!            used with relative error control smaller than about 1.e-8 .
!            to avoid limiting precision difficulties the code requires
!            relerr to be larger than an internally computed relative
!            error parameter which is machine dependent. in particular,
!            pure absolute error is not permitted. if a smaller than
!            allowable value of relerr is attempted, rkf45 increases
!            relerr appropriately and returns control to the user before
!            continuing the integration.
!
!      iflag -- +1,-1  indicator to initialize the code for each new
!            problem. normal input is +1. the user should set iflag=-1
!            only when one-step integrator control is essential. in this
!            case, rkf45 attempts to advance the solution a single step
!            in the direction of tout each time it is called. since this
!            mode of operation results in extra computing overhead, it
!            should be avoided unless needed.
!
!
!  output from rkf45
!
!      y(*) -- solution at t
!      t -- last point reached in integration.
!      iflag = 2 -- integration reached tout. indicates successful retur
!                   and is the normal mode for continuing integration.
!            =-2 -- a single successful step in the direction of tout
!                   has been taken. normal mode for continuing
!                   integration one step at a time.
!            = 3 -- integration was not completed because relative error
!                   tolerance was too small. relerr has been increased
!                   appropriately for continuing.
!            = 4 -- integration was not completed because more than
!                   3000 derivative evaluations were needed. this
!                   is approximately 500 steps.
!            = 5 -- integration was not completed because solution
!                   vanished making a pure relative error test
!                   impossible. must use non-zero abserr to continue.
!                   using the one-step integration mode for one step
!                   is a good way to proceed.
!            = 6 -- integration was not completed because requested
!                   accuracy could not be achieved using smallest
!                   allowable stepsize. user must increase the error
!                   tolerance before continued integration can be
!                   attempted.
!            = 7 -- it is likely that rkf45 is inefficient for solving
!                   this problem. too much output is restricting the
!                   natural stepsize choice. use the one-step integrator
!                   mode.
!            = 8 -- invalid input parameters
!                   this indicator occurs if any of the following is
!                   satisfied -   neqn <= 0
!                                 t=tout  and  iflag /= +1 or -1
!                                 relerr or abserr < 0.
!                                 iflag == 0  or  < -2  or  > 8
!      work(*),iwork(*) -- information which is usually of no interest
!                   to the user but necessary for subsequent calls.
!                   work(1),...,work(neqn) contain the first derivatives
!                   of the solution vector y at t. work(neqn+1) contains
!                   the stepsize h to be attempted on the next step.
!                   iwork(1) contains the derivative evaluation counter.
!
!
!  subsequent calls
!
!    RKF45 returns with all information needed to continue
!    the integration. if the integration reached tout, the user need onl
!    define a new tout and call RKF45 again.  In the one-step integrator
!    mode (iflag=-2) the user must keep in mind that each step taken is
!    in the direction of the current tout.  Upon reaching tout (indicated
!    by changing iflag to 2),the user must then define a new tout and
!    reset iflag to -2 to continue in the one-step integrator mode.
!
!    If the integration was not completed but the user still wants to
!    continue (iflag=3,4 cases), he just calls rkf45 again. with iflag=3
!    the relerr parameter has been adjusted appropriately for continuing
!    the integration. in the case of iflag=4 the function counter will
!    be reset to 0 and another 3000 function evaluations are allowed.
!
!    However,in the case iflag=5, the user must first alter the error
!    criterion to use a positive value of abserr before integration can
!    proceed. if he does not,execution is terminated.
!
!    Also,in the case iflag=6, it is necessary for the user to reset
!    iflag to 2 (or -2 when the one-step integration mode is being used)
!    as well as increasing either abserr,relerr or both before the
!    integration can be continued. if this is not done, execution will
!    be terminated. the occurrence of iflag=6 indicates a trouble spot
!    (solution is changing rapidly,singularity may be present) and it
!    often is inadvisable to continue.
!
!    If iflag=7 is encountered, the user should use the one-step
!    integration mode with the stepsize determined by the code.
!    If the user insists upon continuing the integration with RKF45,
!    he must reset iflag to 2 before calling RKF45 again. otherwise,
!    execution will be terminated.
!
!    If iflag=8 is obtained, integration can not be continued unless
!    the invalid input parameters are corrected.

!    RKF45 should generally not be used when the user is demanding
!    high accuracy.
!
!  Abstract:
!
!    RKF45 integrates a system of NEQN first order ordinary differential
!    equations of the form:
!
!      dY(i)/dT = F(T,Y(1),Y(2),...,Y(NEQN))
!
!    where the Y(1:NEQN) are given at T.
!
!    Typically the subroutine is used to integrate from T to TOUT but it
!    can be used as a one-step integrator to advance the solution a
!    single step in the direction of TOUT.  On return, the parameters in
!    the call list are set for continuing the integration.  The user has
!    only to call RKF45 again (and perhaps define a new value for TOUT).
!    Actually, RKF45 is an interfacing routine which calls subroutine
!    RKFS for the solution.  RKFS in turn calls subroutine FEHL which
!    computes an approximate solution over one step.

!  Parameters:
!
!    Input, external F, a subroutine of the form
!      subroutine f ( t, y, yp )
!      double precision t
!      double precision y(*)
!      double precision yp(*)
!    to evaluate the derivatives YP(I) = dY(I) / dT
!
!    Input, integer NEQN, the number of equations to be integrated.
!

!
!    Input, double precision TOUT, the output point at which solution is
!    desired.
!
!    Input, double precision RELERR, ABSERR, the relative and absolute error
!    tolerances for the local error test.  At each step the code requires:
!      abs(local error) <= relerr*abs(y) + abserr
!    for each component of the local error and solution vectors
!
!    Output, integer IFLAG, indicator for status of integration.
!
!    Workspace, double precision WORK(3+6*NEQN), an array to hold information
!    internal to RKF45 which is necessary for subsequent calls.
!
!    Workspace, integer IWORK(5), an array used to hold information internal
!    to RKF45 which is necessary for subsequent calls.
!
!
!  first call
!
!    The user must provide storage in his calling program for the arrays
!    in the call list  -      y(neqn) , work(3+6*neqn) , iwork(5)  ,
!    declare f in an external statement, supply subroutine f(t,y,yp) and
!    initialize the following parameters-
!
!      neqn -- number of equations to be integrated.  (neqn >= 1)
!
!      y(*) -- vector of initial conditions
!
!      t -- starting point of integration , must be a variable
!
!      tout -- output point at which solution is desired.
!            t=tout is allowed on the first call only, in which case
!            rkf45 returns with iflag=2 if continuation is possible.
!
!      relerr,abserr -- relative and absolute local error tolerances
!            which must be non-negative. relerr must be a variable while
!            abserr may be a constant. the code should normally not be
!            used with relative error control smaller than about 1.e-8 .
!            to avoid limiting precision difficulties the code requires
!            relerr to be larger than an internally computed relative
!            error parameter which is machine dependent. in particular,
!            pure absolute error is not permitted. if a smaller than
!            allowable value of relerr is attempted, rkf45 increases
!            relerr appropriately and returns control to the user before
!            continuing the integration.
!
!      iflag -- +1,-1  indicator to initialize the code for each new
!            problem. normal input is +1. the user should set iflag=-1
!            only when one-step integrator control is essential. in this
!            case, rkf45 attempts to advance the solution a single step
!            in the direction of tout each time it is called. since this
!            mode of operation results in extra computing overhead, it
!            should be avoided unless needed.
!
!
!  output from rkf45
!
!      y(*) -- solution at t
!      t -- last point reached in integration.
!      iflag = 2 -- integration reached tout. indicates successful retur
!                   and is the normal mode for continuing integration.
!            =-2 -- a single successful step in the direction of tout
!                   has been taken. normal mode for continuing
!                   integration one step at a time.
!            = 3 -- integration was not completed because relative error
!                   tolerance was too small. relerr has been increased
!                   appropriately for continuing.
!            = 4 -- integration was not completed because more than
!                   3000 derivative evaluations were needed. this
!                   is approximately 500 steps.
!            = 5 -- integration was not completed because solution
!                   vanished making a pure relative error test
!                   impossible. must use non-zero abserr to continue.
!                   using the one-step integration mode for one step
!                   is a good way to proceed.
!            = 6 -- integration was not completed because requested
!                   accuracy could not be achieved using smallest
!                   allowable stepsize. user must increase the error
!                   tolerance before continued integration can be
!                   attempted.
!            = 7 -- it is likely that rkf45 is inefficient for solving
!                   this problem. too much output is restricting the
!                   natural stepsize choice. use the one-step integrator
!                   mode.
!            = 8 -- invalid input parameters
!                   this indicator occurs if any of the following is
!                   satisfied -   neqn <= 0
!                                 t=tout  and  iflag /= +1 or -1
!                                 relerr or abserr < 0.
!                                 iflag == 0  or  < -2  or  > 8
!      work(*),iwork(*) -- information which is usually of no interest
!                   to the user but necessary for subsequent calls.
!                   work(1),...,work(neqn) contain the first derivatives
!                   of the solution vector y at t. work(neqn+1) contains
!                   the stepsize h to be attempted on the next step.
!                   iwork(1) contains the derivative evaluation counter.
!
!
!  subsequent calls
!
!    RKF45 returns with all information needed to continue
!    the integration. if the integration reached tout, the user need onl
!    define a new tout and call RKF45 again.  In the one-step integrator
!    mode (iflag=-2) the user must keep in mind that each step taken is
!    in the direction of the current tout.  Upon reaching tout (indicated
!    by changing iflag to 2),the user must then define a new tout and
!    reset iflag to -2 to continue in the one-step integrator mode.
!
!    If the integration was not completed but the user still wants to
!    continue (iflag=3,4 cases), he just calls rkf45 again. with iflag=3
!    the relerr parameter has been adjusted appropriately for continuing
!    the integration. in the case of iflag=4 the function counter will
!    be reset to 0 and another 3000 function evaluations are allowed.
!
!    However,in the case iflag=5, the user must first alter the error
!    criterion to use a positive value of abserr before integration can
!    proceed. if he does not,execution is terminated.
!
!    Also,in the case iflag=6, it is necessary for the user to reset
!    iflag to 2 (or -2 when the one-step integration mode is being used)
!    as well as increasing either abserr,relerr or both before the
!    integration can be continued. if this is not done, execution will
!    be terminated. the occurrence of iflag=6 indicates a trouble spot
!    (solution is changing rapidly,singularity may be present) and it
!    often is inadvisable to continue.
!
!    If iflag=7 is encountered, the user should use the one-step
!    integration mode with the stepsize determined by the code.
!    If the user insists upon continuing the integration with RKF45,
!    he must reset iflag to 2 before calling RKF45 again. otherwise,
!    execution will be terminated.
!
!    If iflag=8 is obtained, integration can not be continued unless
!    the invalid input parameters are corrected.
!
!    The arrays work and iwork contain information
!    required for subsequent integration, and should not be altered.

!  Discussion:
!
!    RKFS integrates a system of first order ordinary differential
!    equations as described in the comments for RKF45.
!
!    The arrays yp, f1, f2, f3, f4, and f5 (of dimension at least neqn) and
!    the variables h, savre, savae, nfe, kop, init, jflag and kflag are used
!    internally by the code and appear in the call list to eliminate
!    local retention of variables between calls.  Accordingly, they
!    should not be altered.  Items of possible interest are
!
!      YP  - the derivative of the solution vector at T;
!      H   - an appropriate stepsize to be used for the next step;
!      NFE - the number of derivative function evaluations.
!
!    The expense is controlled by restricting the number
!    of function evaluations to be approximately MAXNFE.
!    As set, this corresponds to about 500 steps.
!
!    REMIN is the minimum acceptable value of RELERR.  Attempts
!    to obtain higher accuracy with this subroutine are usually
!    very expensive and often unsuccessful.

!    RKFS integrates a system of first order ordinary differential
!    equations as described in the comments for RKF45.
!
!    The arrays yp, f1, f2, f3, f4, and f5 (of dimension at least neqn) and
!    the variables h, savre, savae, nfe, kop, init, jflag and kflag are used
!    internally by the code and appear in the call list to eliminate
!    local retention of variables between calls.  Accordingly, they
!    should not be altered.  Items of possible interest are
!
!      YP  - the derivative of the solution vector at T;
!      H   - an appropriate stepsize to be used for the next step;
!      NFE - the number of derivative function evaluations.
!
!    The expense is controlled by restricting the number
!    of function evaluations to be approximately MAXNFE.
!    As set, this corresponds to about 500 steps.
!
!    REMIN is the minimum acceptable value of RELERR.  Attempts
!    to obtain higher accuracy with this subroutine are usually
!    very expensive and often unsuccessful.

!  Core integrator for taking a single step
!
!     The tolerances have been scaled to avoid premature underflow in
!     computing the error tolerance function ET.
!     To avoid problems with zero crossings, relative error is measured
!     using the average of the magnitudes of the solution at the
!     beginning and end of a step.
!     The error estimate formula has been grouped to control loss of
!     significance.
!
!     To distinguish the various arguments, H is not permitted
!     to become smaller than 26 units of roundoff in T.
!     Practical limits on the change in the stepsize are enforced to
!     smooth the stepsize selection process and to avoid excessive
!     chattering on problems having discontinuities.
!     To prevent unnecessary failures, the code uses 9/10 the stepsize
!     it estimates will succeed.
!
!     After a step failure, the stepsize is not allowed to increase for
!     the next attempted step.  This makes the code more efficient on
!     problems having discontinuities and more effective in general
!     since local extrapolation is being used and extra caution seems
!     warranted.
